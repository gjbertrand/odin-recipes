<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Yeast</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Bread Flour</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>
